# LED Replacement for DCA Lamps

## Revision 3

To do: document this better, add images

This is a work-in-progress LED bulb to replace the DCA lamps that were used in many old film projectors. It takes in 21VAC at the base, converts that to very ripply DC, and drives a Cree XHP 50.2 LED. Message me with questions/advice/suggestions/anything.
