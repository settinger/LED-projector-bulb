# LED Replacement for DCA Lamps

This is a WORK IN PROGRESS. The current *iteration* almost fits in my projector (an Argus Showmaster 750A), so it *might* fit in your projector and it *might not*. I need to move the big capacitors to the top of the top PCB, but in this weird year I simply haven't had the wherewithal to do it yet.
